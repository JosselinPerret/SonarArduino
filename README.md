# Sonar Project using Arduino
## What is this ?
It is a basic project made by *ZenkoLab* for no special reason.       
The project is using an Arduino with other composants (*all composants are detailled in the section below*).       
The sonar will scan the area around him (15 to 165 degrees) and calculate the distance between it and an object.      

## Composants needed
* __An Arduino__ *(Here i am using an Arduino Mega 2560 because i had some troubles with the Arduino Uno)*
* __Jumper Cables__ *(All types except __female to female__)*
* __An ultrasonic sensor__ *(Here i am using the HC-SR04 one)*
* __A breadboard__ *(If necessary)*
* __A micro servo motor__ *(Here i am using the SM-S2309S one)*

## Requirements
* __Arduino IDE__ *(So you can control your Arduino and its ultrasonic sensor)*
* __Processing IDE__ *(So you can show sonar's interface)*

## How to do it ?
