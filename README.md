# Sonar
## What is this ?
It is a basic project made by *ZenkoLab* for no reason.  The project is using an Aruidno with other composants (*all composants are detailled in the section below*).  The sonar will scan the area around him (15 to 165 degrees) and calculate the distance between it and an object.

## Composants needed
* __An Arduino__ *(Here i am using an Arduino Mega 2560 because i had some troubles with the Arduino Uno)*
* __Jumper Cables__ *(All types except __female to female__)*
* __An ultrasonic sensor__ *(Here i am using the HC-SR04 one)*
* __A breadboard__ *(If necessery)*
* __A micro servo motor__ *(Here i am using the SM-S2309S one)*

## How to do it ?
